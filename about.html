          Our Story
        </h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          Fit-24/7 was founded in 2010 with a simple mission: to provide a
          welcoming and inclusive space for people to pursue their fitness
          goals. Our founder, John Smith, was a lifelong fitness enthusiast
          who had experienced firsthand the frustration of gyms that were
          overcrowded, unwelcoming, and intimidating.
        </p>
        <p>
          John saw an opportunity to create something different - a gym that
          was open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with a wide variety of
          equipment and amenities to suit every fitness level and interest.
          But more than that, he wanted Fit-24/7 to be a place where everyone
          felt comfortable and supported, regardless of their age, gender, or
          fitness background.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, Fit-24/7 has grown into a thriving community of
          fitness enthusiasts who share John's vision. Our team of experienced
          trainers and staff are dedicated to helping every member achieve
          their goals, whether that's improving their health, building muscle,
          losing weight, or simply feeling more confident and energized.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that fitness is about more than just working out - it's
          about building relationships, pushing yourself to new heights, and
          becoming the best version of yourself. At Fit-24/7, we're proud to
          be a part of that journey for each and every one of our members.

      <div class="flex flex-col text-center w-full mb-20">
        <h1 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl font-medium title-font mb-4 text-gray-900">Our Goals</h1>
        <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
        <ul>
          <li>To help every member achieve their fitness goals, no matter their starting point</li>
          <li>To provide a welcoming and inclusive community for all fitness levels and backgrounds</li>
          <li>To offer a wide variety of equipment and amenities to suit every interest and need</li>
          <li>To promote healthy habits and lifestyle changes that last beyond the gym</li>
          <li>To continually improve our services and facilities to meet the evolving needs of our members</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
          Our second goal is to create a welcoming and inclusive community for all fitness levels and backgrounds. We
          want everyone who walks through our doors to feel welcome and supported. We strive to create a positive,
          inclusive environment where our members can feel comfortable, confident, and motivated to achieve their goals.
        </p>

        <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
          Thirdly, we aim to provide a wide variety of equipment and amenities to suit every interest and need. From
          cardio machines and free weights to group fitness classes and personal training sessions, we have everything
          our members need to achieve their fitness goals.
        </p>

        <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
          Fourthly, we are committed to promoting healthy habits and lifestyle changes that last beyond the gym. We
          believe that fitness is not just about what you do in the gym, but also about making healthy choices in your
          daily life. That's why we offer resources and support to help our members make positive changes to their diet,
          sleep habits, and overall lifestyle.
        </p>

        <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
          Finally, we are dedicated to continually improving our services and facilities to meet the evolving needs of
          our members. We listen to feedback from our members and strive to provide the best possible experience for
          everyone who walks through our doors.
        </p>

        <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
          These goals are at the heart of everything we do at Fit-24/7, and we're committed to helping our members
          achieve their fitness goals and lead healthier, happier lives.
